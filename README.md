A simple Applikation for Pocketbook to download the german newspaper die Zeit.
I created it, to start learning C++ and understand the SDK of Pocketbook.

## Installation
Download and unzip the file from releases and place the nextcloud.app into the "applications" folder of your pocketbook. Once you disconnect the Pocketbook from the PC, the application should be visibile in the application launcher.

### Tested on
* Pocketbook HD3 (PB623) (V. U623.6.0.926)

### Known issues
* The main menu of the PB shows new books only if it turns into sleep modus. Otherwise the new books can only be opened from the nextcloud applicaton.

## Disclamer

Use as your own risk! 
Even though the possibility is really low, the application could harm your device or even break it.
